## Hi I'm Andrew!

I'm a Javascript engineer, a game developer, and fitness enthusiast. 

Currently, I am attending Hack Reactor which is a full immersion advanced software engineering environment where I have refined many of my programming techniques and learned best practices - some new, some old. 

I'm interested in web technology especially in applications where game design meets practicality - flash games, mobile apps, etc. are all fair game when it comes to garnering my attention. I have a feeling that eventually, somewhere down the line, that HTML games will have their time in the sun.

Beyond coding and games I have a, perhaps unhealthy, obsession with fitness especially in the sports science department and find myself often lost in myriad of actual science and broscience for hours on end. Urban exploration is also another topic that draws me to waste more hours than browsing TV tropes and wikipedia.
