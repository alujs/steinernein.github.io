[Currying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is probably something misunderstood by most bloggers, heck, here's a disclaimer: I probably have no idea what I am talking about, but I do know that partial application and currying are completely different from one another.

Here's the typical blogger's post on currying for Javascript ([blog example here](http://www.dustindiaz.com/javascript-curry/), [here](http://ejohn.org/blog/partial-functions-in-javascript/), [and here](https://medium.com/the-javascript-collection/ce6da2d324fe)): 
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{% raw %}
var bind = function(func){
 var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
 return function(stuff){
     var _args = args.concat(stuff)
     return func.apply(null, _args);
 }
};

var adderMaker = function(a,b){
    return a+b;
};

var adder1 = bind(adderMaker, 1);
adder1(2); // prints out 3. 
var adder3 = bind(adderMaker, 3);
adder3(3); // prints out 6.
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

And then there is this wonderful snippet on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying#Contrast_with_partial_function_application):

Currying and partial function application are often conflated.[11] One of the significant differences between the two is that a call to a partially applied function returns the result right away, not another function down the currying chain; this distinction can be illustrated clearly for functions whose arity is greater than two.[12]

Basically, what they're actually talking about is [partial application]().  Now, I am going to go over a very brief example of currying and what it could be used for, here goes: 
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{% raw %}
var bigFunc = function(a,b,c) {
 return a+b+c;    
}

var curry = function( func, n, res ){
  var count = n; 
   return function( x ) { 
      var arity = count; 
      var args = res || [];
      args = args.concat(x);
      arity--;
      if(arity === 0) {
       
       return func.apply(null, args);
      } else {
        return curry(func, arity, args);
      }
   }
}


var curried = curry(bigFunc, 3);

curried('a')('b')(); // prints out 'abundefined'
curried(); // returns a function
curried()(); // returns a function
curried()()(); // returns 'undefinedundefinedundefined'
curried('a')('b')('c'); // returns 'abc'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the major difference between currying and partial application is that currying segments each argument of the function that is being curried rather than reducing the arity by one. In other words, a curried function will only accept one argument and never anything more than that.

So, what are some of the use cases of currying? I can think of a few off the top of my head; customized functions, chained generators that can branch, and trivia for cocktail parties.
